Lesson-1.ino:
A simple sketch that blinks the user led on for one second and then off, repeating this pattern forever.

Lesson-2.ino:
Using the button to turn on a led.  Using the switch to prevent the user from turning on the led.

Lesson-3.ino:
Using the accelerometer to light the led whenever the board is picked up.

Lesson-4.ino:
Using the neopixel library.

Lesson-5.ino:
Using the temperature sensor to light neopixels different based on the temperature.

Lesson-6.ino:
Using the light sensor to make a beep from the speaker.

Lesson-7.ino:
Using the sound sensor to light neopixels brighter when sound is louder.

Lesson-8.ino:
Using the capacitive touch sensors to make noise.

Lesson-9.ino:
Button generated interrupt.  Cycle through neopixels while lighting up the red led
whenever the button is pressed.  Compare and contrast with polled approach.

Lesson-10.ino:
Combine everything to create a cool app.

Lesson-Bonus.ino
Play some music.
